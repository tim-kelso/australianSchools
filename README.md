# australianSchools
I aim to investigate historical trends in Australian schools using data from 2008-2020 (available here: https://www.acara.edu.au/contact-us/acara-data-access).
I'm particularly interested in:
1. Whether enrolments (gross and proportional) in Government, Catholic, and Independent schools have changed
2. If and how demographic characteristics vary across Australian states and territories
